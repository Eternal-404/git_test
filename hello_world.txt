As Qualcomm prepares for the mid-year launch of their forthcoming Snapdragon X SoCs for PCs, and the 
eagerly anticipated Oryon CPU cores within, the company is finally shoring up their official product 
plans, and releasing some additional technical details in the process. Thus far the company has been 
demonstrating their Snapdragon X Elite SoC in its highest-performing, fully-enabled configuration. 
But the retail Snapdragon X Elite will not be a single part; instead, Qualcomm is preparing a whole 
range of chip configurations for various price/performance tiers in the market. Altogether, there 
will be 3 Snapdragon X Elite SKUs that differ in CPU and GPU performance.
